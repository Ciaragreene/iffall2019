<p><br>And if I say to you tomorrow,
<br>"Take my hand, child, come with me.
<br>It's to a castle I will take you,
<br>Where what's to be, 
<br>they say will be."</p>

<b><SPAN STYLE="text-transform:uppercase">[chorus]</SPAN></b>
<p><br>See us spin,
<br>Sail away,
<br>Leave today,
<br>Way up high in the sky.
<br>But the wind won't blow,
<br>You really shouldn't go,
<br>It only goes to show
<br>That you will be mine
<br>By takin' our time.</p>

<SPAN STYLE="text-transform:lowercase">[VERSE 2]</SPAN>
<p><br>And if you say to me tomorrow,
<br>Oh what fun it all would be.
<br>Then what's to stop us, pretty baby,
<br>But what is and what should never be.</p>

<b><SPAN STYLE="text-transform:uppercase">[chorus]</SPAN></b>
<p>Catch the wind,
<br>See us spin,
<br>Sail away,
<br>Leave today,
<br>Way up high
<br>In the sky.But the wind won't blow,
<br>You really shouldn't go,
<br>It only goes to show
<br>That you will be mine
<br>By takin' our time.</p>

<SPAN STYLE="text-transform:lowercase">[VERSE 3]</SPAN>
<p><br>So if you wake up with the sunrise,
<br>And all your dreams are still as new,
<br>And happiness is what you need so bad,
<br>Girl, the answer lies with you.</p>

<b><SPAN STYLE="text-transform:uppercase">[chorus]</SPAN></b>
<p><br>Catch the wind,
<br>See us spin,
<br>Sail away,
<br>Leave today,
<br>Way up high
<br>In the sky.But the wind won't blow,
<br>You really shouldn't go,
<br>It only goes to show
<br>That you will be mine,
<br>By takin' our time.</p>
<SPAN STYLE="text-transform:uppercase">[OUTRO]</SPAN>

<p><br>Oh the wind won't blow
<br>And we really shouldn't go
<br>And it only goes to show.</p>

<p><br>Catch the wind,
<br>We're gonna see it spin,
<br>We're gonna sail,
<br>Leave today</p>

<p><br>Everybody I know 
<br>seems to know me well
<br>But they're never gonna know that I'm gonna move like hell.</p>

<p><br>Ah, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
<br>Oh, I love ya!
<br>Baby, baby, babe!
<br>Oh, I love ya.

You know, know, know, know, know, know, come on now.</p>
