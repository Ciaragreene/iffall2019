		<h1> Feedback for Natalie Snyder </h1>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Out of the three design explorations, the most successful one is the middle, neon yellow design. I really enjoy the cutout aestheic as it appears extremely graphic and eyecatching. I would encourage you to continue to use neon for your color pallette as it seems to evoke a clean and modern tone which I believe fits the quotes well.</li> 
				<li> I would be careful with creating hyphens and line-breaks. Unless it's neccecary for the composition, you should be able to avoid most hyphenation. </li>
				<li> Your cards may benefit from a  typeface with a larger x-height for easier readability or use a larger font size. </li> </p> </ol>
